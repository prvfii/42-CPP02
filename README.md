	Exploring operator overloading, fixed-point numbers, and advanced C++ concepts.

____________________________________________________________________________________

Description

CPP Module 02 is the third project in the 42 C++ Piscine series. This module introduces operator overloading and a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming. The focus is on implementing custom classes, managing resources, and understanding fixed-point arithmetic through a hands-on approach.

This project emphasizes the importance of writing efficient, reusable, and well-structured C++ code.

Topics Covered

	•	Operator Overloading:
	•	Understanding and implementing custom operators (+, -, *, /, =, ==, etc.).
	•	Overloading the stream insertion operator (<<).
	•	Fixed-Point Numbers:
	•	Creating a custom class to represent fixed-point numbers.
	•	Implementing precise arithmetic operations.
	•	Constructors and Destructors:
	•	Copy constructors.
	•	Assignment operators (operator=).
	•	Deep vs. shallow copying.
	•	Canonical Form:
	•	Ensuring classes adhere to the Orthodox Canonical Form.
